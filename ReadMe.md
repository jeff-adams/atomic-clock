> python code to display the time and current weather on a RGB Matrix

I am learning Python while coding this application. The rgbmatrix library is not mine and taken from [rpi-rbg-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python) on GitHub. This project is for my personal use, as I don't know what I'm doing in Python and can not guarantee any success.
